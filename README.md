üìà Real-Time Market Data Forecasting ‚Äì Honours Project

This project simulates and analyzes real-time financial market data using dummy datasets for feature engineering, data exploration, preprocessing, and visualization. The goal is to establish a pipeline that could later be adapted for real market prediction tasks.

üß† Project Objectives


> Create in-memory dummy datasets to simulate real-time data streams.

> Analyze feature distributions, types, and missing values.

> Impute missing data (numeric and categorical).

> Visualize distributions and correlations of features.

> Prepare the groundwork for future model integration for market forecasting.



üîß Setup and Dependencies

This project is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Make sure to install the following dependencies:

> bash
> Copy
> Edit
> pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

üìä What We Did (INIT)

Generated synthetic market feature data with continuous, categorical, and missing values to mimic real-world scenarios.

Created a dummy submission format to simulate prediction outputs.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA):

Displayed data shapes and types.

Visualized numerical and categorical distributions.

Handled missing values with median and mode imputation.

Plotted correlation matrices for numeric features.


üñºÔ∏è Sample Visualizations

Histograms and KDE plots for numerical distributions.

Count plots for categorical features.

Correlation heatmaps to identify linear dependencies.



üìå Next Steps (Future Work)

> Integrate live market APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).

> Develop real-time feature engineering pipelines.

> Apply machine learning models for predictive forecasting.

> Optimize forecasting performance for live environments.
